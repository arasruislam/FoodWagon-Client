          <p className="px-4 py-2 text-justify">
            In a controlled components rect, <strong>State</strong> handles all
            the form data. If your use controlled component your have all
            control of your form data. Where developer decide the value insert
            or not. Controlled components are predictable. On the Other hand
            Uncontrolled components manage by only the <strong>DOM</strong>. In
            a uncontrolled component is a optional to have a state but it must
            be have <strong>react Ref</strong>. You can perform validation on
            the input data only after the form is submitted in the uncontrolled
            components in react.

          </h1>
          <p className="px-4 py-2 text-justify">
            First of all we need to install prop-type in your app. we validate
            them by setting the propTypes property of the FooComponent component
            to an object that has the names of the props to validate as the
            keys. And the corresponding values are the data type of the props.
            We pass in the values for the props when we reference the component
            in App. If we pass in prop values that donâ€™t match the type
            specified, we get an error.
